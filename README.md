# Sentiment Analysis 
## applied to movie reviews

In this project, we attempt to analyze the general feeling expressed from a text. This general feeling is either **positive** or **negative**. 
To do so we convert thousands of texts into a dataframe with thousands of rows. We then assign a "_sentiment_" or "_feeling_"of either **0** or **1** depending
on the opinion expressed by its author:
- 1 being positive
- 0 being negative

After changing the texts into a simpler format and removing all unnecessary elements such as punctuation and stopwords, we train 
our Naive Bayes Classifier model to make the eventual _sentiment_ prediction.
