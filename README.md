In this project, we attempt to analyze the general feeling expressed from a text. This general feeling is either positive or negative. 
To do so we convert thousands of texts into a dataframe with thousands of rows. We then assign a "sentiment" of either 0 or 1 depending
on the opinion expressed by its author. After changing the texts into a simpler format and removing all unnecessary elements, we train 
our Naive Bayes Classifier model to make eventual predictions.
